# React Budget App

Made from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz8x71BiGXg) tutorial from [WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw).

This tutorial was a great overview of familiar React basics and also introduced me to intermediate React concepts like custom hooks, the useContext hook, and more. I got to practice the useState hook and CRUD operations in React for a SPA with all the data in localstorage. I also explored using modals which I haven't used before. I like the simple look of the app and how most styling was done with Bootstrap inline styles. 

For future features, it would be nice to have a more customized look and design to the app, and maybe allow for user login and registration.
